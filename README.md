# Sample notebooks: CHUV Collaboration

This repository contains sample notebooks to analyze biopsies using the tools developed in the Shivalab at PSI and ETH. Most of the provided scripts were developed by Daniel Paysan and Saradha Venkatachalapathy.

Note that the code has not been run on any data but is just to provide an idea of the functions that can be used to achieve important steps within a basic analysis workflow.
